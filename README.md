## About File Specter
The file inspector or as I like to call it **File Specter** is a multithreaded Linux daemon that monitors your files and notifies you via desktop notifications if they have been accessed.


## The Reason Behind It
The main reason I created this daemon is primarily because I'm trying to teach myself systems-level programming in UNIX-based systems and familiarize myself with the available system libraries and their APIs. So this is probably not the best way I could write a daemon as I'm still learning. Therefore, if you have any suggestions for improvement or if you spot bugs, you can contribute to this repository or reach out to me, so I can learn from it.
